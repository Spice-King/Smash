This will help them develop solid fundamentals.<br><br>10-20 Mirror match them yourself, I've found these levels are REALLY important in learning good / bad habits. I had my villager spam f-smash even after reaching lvl 50 after learning it from a falco in these levels. It was so bad I reset him and did it over<br><br>20-50 I like to rotate between 4 characters for this training session. First, pick your main and style on them. Next, pick a "ground-based" character who focuses on tilts and grabs. Then, grab an aerial/spacing character. Last, mirror match them yourself to try and teach specific combos, then let them fight a level 9 mirror again.<br><br>Using this training method, all 3 of my Amiibos are able to consitently 2-stock a level 9 by the time they hit the low 40s.<br><br>Do NOT be afraid to "spot" train the Amiibo. If you notice he isn't using projectiles enough, switch to the mirror and spam the shit out of them.<br><br>Things to remember to teach your amiibo<br><br>Pummel when grabbing<br><br>Different throws at different percents (my villager down throws at low percents, and pummel back throws at high ones)<br><br>To grab at all<br><br>To use items (don't train TOO much, but def. enough so they can use robs gyro, tree fragment, or pac fruit)<br><br>Running Upsmash<br><br>Fast Fall Aerials<br><br>How to approach/space<br><br>Also, be mindful that amiibos do extra damage EVEN IF NEVER FED EQUIPMENT. So Amiibo vs. Amiibo fights are the most fair, but player vs. Amiibo is good training for 2 reasons.<br><br>One is that it helps your defensive game, since attacks hit much harder you gotta avoid more. Two is that it helps your punish game, because cpus are so good at dodging and stuff that it'll encourage you to "push" your punishes.</div></div><div id=footer>Test</div></body></html>
